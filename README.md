# Indian Counterfeit Banknote Detection using SVM

Counterfeiting is a serious crime that affects the finances of a country. In India, counterfeit banknotes have become a major problem in the market. Although various fake note detection methods are available worldwide, most of them are hardware-based and costly. Therefore, we propose a system that focuses on public access to identify counterfeit banknotes.

Our proposed system uses machine learning techniques to identify the legitimacy of banknotes by checking for specific security features such as watermarks, latent images, security threads, etc. We extract and encode these security features from the input image and perform feature detection and classification using a support vector machine (SVM).

# Features
- Detection of counterfeit banknotes using machine learning techniques
- Extraction and encoding of security features from the input image
- Feature detection and classification using support vector machine (SVM)

# Getting Started
To use our Indian counterfeit banknote detection system, you can follow these steps:

- Clone the project from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies (list any dependencies and versions)
- Configure the system according to your needs (directory settings)
- Run the application

# Usage
Once the system is up and running, users can input an image of a banknote to the system. The system will then extract the security features from the input image and use the SVM classifier to determine if the banknote is genuine or counterfeit. The system will output a result indicating the legitimacy of the banknote.
